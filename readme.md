MEV-Aware Liquidity Sniper
This project implements a high-frequency liquidity sniping bot for Uniswap V2. The bot monitors the Ethereum mempool for liquidity addition events, validates token safety, and executes trades atomically using Flashbots bundles to maximize profit while protecting against MEV risks.

Features
Real-Time Mempool Monitoring: Detects pending transactions involving addLiquidity and addLiquidityETH events.

Token Validation: Identifies honeypot tokens and validates safety parameters, such as tax rates and ownership risks.

MEV Protection: Submits Flashbots bundles for atomic execution to prevent frontrunning and backrunning attacks.

Flexible Configuration: Easily extendable for advanced token checks and multi-block strategies.

Prerequisites
Dependencies
Python 3.8+
Libraries:
web3: For Ethereum blockchain interactions.
eth-account: For signing transactions.
flashbots: For submitting MEV-aware bundles.
Install dependencies via pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install web3 eth-account flashbots
Ethereum Node Access
Infura Project ID: Register at Infura to get an Ethereum API URL.
Flashbots Access
Generate a private key for Flashbots relay interactions. Use this key in the configuration.
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/uniswap-sniper.git
cd uniswap-sniper
Replace placeholders in uniswap_sniper.py:

INFURA_URL: Replace with your Infura API URL.
PRIVATE_KEY: Replace with your Ethereum private key.
path_to_relay_private_key: Provide the path to your Flashbots private key.
Usage
Start the bot: Run the script to start monitoring the mempool:

bash
Copy code
python uniswap_sniper.py
Behavior:

The bot listens for liquidity addition transactions in real-time.
It validates tokens for safety and profitability.
Once validated, the bot constructs and submits a Flashbots bundle for atomic execution.
Configuration
Honeypot Detection: The bot simulates token transfers to detect potential honeypots. Update the detect_honeypot function in uniswap_sniper.py for additional checks.

Tax Rate: Update the MAX_TAX_RATE constant to adjust the acceptable tax rate.

Gas Optimization: Modify priority fee calculations in the construct_and_submit_bundle function for better gas management.

Risks and Considerations
Gas Costs: Ensure you have enough ETH in your wallet to cover transaction costs.

Token Risks: Tokens with hidden restrictions or malicious behaviors can result in losses. Use rigorous validation checks.

MEV Risks: While Flashbots offers MEV protection, unexpected network behaviors can still pose risks.

Future Work
Advanced Honeypot Detection: Incorporate machine learning models for automated analysis.

Cross-Chain Sniping: Extend support for liquidity sniping on other DEXes and blockchains.

Profit Simulation: Enhance profit calculation for dynamic bundle prioritization.
